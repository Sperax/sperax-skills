# SPA Staking & Governance Guide

The Sperax governance system uses a **vote-escrowed** model: lock SPA to get veSPA, which gives governance voting power and protocol fee rewards.

## Token Overview

### SPA — Governance & Value Accrual

| Property | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| Chain | Arbitrum One |
| Address | `0x5575552988A3A80504bBaeB1311674fCFd40aD4B` |
| Value accrual | 30% of USDs yield + 100% of protocol fees → buyback-and-burn |
| Also on | Ethereum: `0xB4A3B0Faf0Ab53df58001804DdA5Bfc6a3D59008` |

### veSPA — Governance Power

Lock your SPA for 7 days to 4 years to receive veSPA:

```
veSPA = SPA × (lockup_days / 365)
```

- **Minimum lock**: 7 days
- **Maximum lock**: 4 years (1,461 days)
- **Decay**: veSPA decays linearly toward your lock expiry
- **Rewards**: 100% of USDs protocol fees + 420,000 xSPA/week

**Example**: Lock 1,000 SPA for 2 years → receive 2,000 veSPA (decaying over time)

### xSPA — Reward Token

xSPA is the reward distributed to veSPA stakers weekly (Thursdays UTC).

| Option | What happens |
|--------|-------------|
| Stake xSPA → veSPA | 1:1 ratio, but requires ≥180-day lock |
| Redeem xSPA → SPA | 0.5–1.0 SPA over 15–180 days |

**Redemption formula**:
```
Receivable SPA = (xSPA × (redeemDuration + 150)) / 330
```

- Redeem over 15 days → ~0.5 SPA per xSPA
- Redeem over 180 days → 1.0 SPA per xSPA

## Staking Walkthrough

### Step 1: Get SPA on Arbitrum

Buy SPA on Arbitrum One via any DEX (Camelot, Uniswap). If you have SPA on Ethereum, bridge it to Arbitrum first.

### Step 2: Lock SPA → veSPA

1. Go to [app.sperax.io](https://app.sperax.io)
2. Navigate to the Staking section
3. Choose lock duration (longer = more veSPA)
4. Approve and lock SPA

### Step 3: Earn Rewards

- **Fees**: Distributed weekly in USDs
- **xSPA**: 420,000 xSPA distributed weekly (per SIP-66)
- **Claim**: Visit the Staking page to claim accumulated rewards

### Step 4: Manage xSPA

Choose to either:
- **Stake** into veSPA (1:1, but requires ≥180-day lock)
- **Redeem** to SPA (0.5–1.0 ratio based on vesting period)

## Governance Process

Sperax uses a 4-phase governance model:

| Phase | Activity | Duration |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Phase 0 | Discord ideation | Open-ended |
| Phase 1 | Forum SIP proposal | 48-hour discussion minimum |
| Phase 2 | Snapshot vote | 3 days, veSPA-weighted |
| Phase 3 | Engineering implementation | Varies |

**Voting**: Snapshot.org with veSPA weighting
- Quorum: 200M veSPA
- Passing: >50% Yes votes

## Key Contracts (Arbitrum)

| Contract | Address |
|----------|---------|
| SPA | `0x5575552988A3A80504bBaeB1311674fCFd40aD4B` |
| veSPA Proxy | `0x2e2071180682Ce6C247B1eF93d382D509F5F6A17` |
| xSPA | `0x0966E72256d6055145902F72F9D3B6a194B9cCc3` |

## Agent Tips

When helping users with SPA staking:
1. Emphasize the tradeoff: longer lock = more veSPA = more rewards, but less liquidity
2. xSPA redemption: longer redeem period = better ratio (max 1:1 at 180 days)
3. Check current APYs at [app.sperax.io](https://app.sperax.io) before recommending
4. Governance requires veSPA — you must lock SPA first
