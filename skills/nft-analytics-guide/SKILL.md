# NFT Analytics Guide

A practical guide to analyzing NFT markets and collections using free tools and on-chain data.

## Key NFT Metrics

### Collection-Level Metrics

| Metric | What It Means | Good Sign |
|--------|--------------|-----------|
| **Floor Price** | Cheapest available NFT in collection | Stable or rising over weeks |
| **Total Volume** | All-time trading volume | >1,000 ETH for established collections |
| **Unique Holders** | Number of distinct wallets | >30% of supply held by unique wallets |
| **Holder/Supply Ratio** | Holders ÷ Supply | >0.5 (more holders than concentrated) |
| **Listed %** | What % of supply is for sale | 5–15% is healthy |
| **Sales Velocity** | Number of sales per day | Consistent daily sales > sporadic |
| **Wash Trading %** | Fake volume between same wallets | <10% is acceptable |
| **Royalty Revenue** | Ongoing income for creators | Shows sustainable business model |

### Individual NFT Metrics

| Metric | What It Means |
|--------|--------------|
| **Rarity Score** | How unique the traits are |
| **Last Sale Price** | What it actually sold for |
| **Trait Floor** | Floor price of NFTs with the same rare trait |
| **Ownership History** | How many previous owners, holding time |

## Free Analytics Tools

### Collection Analysis

| Tool | What It Provides | Access |
|------|-----------------|--------|
| **OpenSea** | Floor, volume, listed %, activity | Free (web) |
| **Blur** | Floor, bids, depth charts | Free (web) |
| **NFTGo** | Market overview, whale tracking, portfolio | Free tier |
| **Reservoir** | Multi-marketplace aggregated data | Free API |
| **DappRadar** | NFT collection rankings, volume | Free tier |

### Rarity Tools

| Tool | What It Calculates |
|------|-------------------|
| **Rarity.tools** | Trait-weighted rarity scores |
| **HowRare.is** | Solana NFT rarity |
| **Trait Sniper** | Real-time rarity with alerts |
| **Rarity Sniper** | Community-driven rarity rankings |

### On-Chain Analysis

| Tool | What It Provides |
|------|-----------------|
| **Dune Analytics** | Custom SQL queries on NFT data |
| **Flipside Crypto** | NFT analytics dashboards |
| **Etherscan** | Raw transfer and sale events |

## Wash Trading Detection

Wash trading is selling NFTs between your own wallets to inflate volume.

### Detection Methods

| Signal | How to Spot |
|--------|------------|
| **Same buyer/seller** | Same address on both sides (obvious) |
| **Wallet cluster** | Multiple wallets funded from same address |
| **Back-and-forth** | A sells to B, B sells back to A |
| **Round-trip timing** | Buy and sell within same block/minute |
| **No price discovery** | Sales always at same price |
| **Zero royalties** | Using platforms that avoid royalties (reducing cost of wash) |

### Wash Trading Indicators

```
Suspicious if:
- >50% of volume from <10 wallets
- Average holding time <1 hour
- Same NFTs traded repeatedly between same addresses
- Volume spikes without holder growth
```

### Tools for Detection

| Tool | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| **Hildobby's Dune dashboard** | Filters wash trades from real volume |
| **NFTGo wash trade filter** | Tags suspicious transactions |
| **CryptoSlam** | Reports adjusted volume (excluding wash) |

## Marketplace Comparison

| Marketplace | Fee | Royalties | Best For |
|-------------|-----|-----------|----------|
| **OpenSea** | 2.5% | Creator-set (often optional) | Discovery, variety |
| **Blur** | 0% | Optional | Pro traders, floor sweeping |
| **LooksRare** | 2% | Enforced on some | LOOKS token rewards |
| **Magic Eden** | 2% | Creator-set | Multi-chain (ETH, Solana, BTC) |
| **Reservoir** | 0% (protocol) | Varies | API/aggregation layer |

### Aggregators

| Tool | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| **Gem (by OpenSea)** | Cross-marketplace sweeping |
| **Blur** | Also aggregates listings |
| **Reservoir** | API-level aggregation for builders |

## ERC Standards for NFTs

| Standard | What It Is | Use Case |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| **ERC-721** | Unique tokens (1 of 1) | PFPs, art, collectibles |
| **ERC-1155** | Multi-token (copies allowed) | Gaming items, tickets |
| **ERC-6551** | Token-bound accounts (NFTs as wallets) | NFTs that own assets |
| **ERC-8004** | On-chain agent identity | AI agents as NFTs with reputation |

> **Sperax context**: ERC-8004 is the standard Sperax created for on-chain AI agent identity. Each agent is minted as an NFT with metadata about its capabilities, reputation score, and validation status. It's deployed on 12 chains.

## NFT Valuation Framework

### For PFP/Art Collections

| Factor | Weight | What to Check |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| **Community** | 30% | Discord activity, holder engagement, celebrity holders |
| **Floor stability** | 25% | Look at 30/90 day floor chart, not just current |
| **Volume quality** | 20% | Real volume after removing wash trades |
| **Utility** | 15% | Token-gated access, airdrops, real-world perks |
| **Team** | 10% | Track record, transparency, roadmap execution |

### For Utility NFTs

| Factor | Weight | What to Check |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| **Functional value** | 40% | What does holding this NFT actually get you? |
| **Protocol adoption** | 25% | Is the underlying protocol growing? |
| **Supply dynamics** | 20% | Mint rate, burn mechanics, total cap |
| **Revenue generation** | 15% | Does the NFT generate yield or fee share? |

## Dune Analytics Queries for NFTs

### Collection Volume (Last 30 Days)

```sql
SELECT
    date_trunc('day', block_time) as day,
    COUNT(*) as sales,
    SUM(amount_usd) as volume_usd
FROM nft.trades
WHERE nft_contract_address = 0x... -- collection address
  AND block_time > now() - interval '30 days'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
```

### Holder Distribution

```sql
SELECT
    COUNT(DISTINCT wallet) as unique_holders,
    SUM(CASE WHEN balance = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as single_holders,
    SUM(CASE WHEN balance > 10 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as whales
FROM (
    SELECT to as wallet, COUNT(*) as balance
    FROM erc721_transfers
    WHERE contract_address = 0x...
    GROUP BY 1
)
```

## Agent Tips

1. **Always check for wash trading** — reported volume can be 50–90% fake
2. **Floor price is the most honest metric** — it's the actual cost to enter
3. **Low listed %** is usually bullish — holders aren't trying to sell
4. **Whale concentration** — if top 10 wallets hold >30%, they control the floor
5. **Use aggregators for best prices** — don't buy on just one marketplace
6. **ERC-8004 NFTs are different** — they represent AI agents with reputation, not art
7. **Bear market NFTs** — focus on utility and revenue, not hype
