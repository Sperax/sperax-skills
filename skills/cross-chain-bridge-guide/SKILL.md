# Cross-Chain Bridge Guide

Bridges move assets between blockchains. This guide covers how they work, which to use, and how to stay safe.

## Why Bridges Exist

Each blockchain is an isolated system. Bridges connect them:

```
Ethereum ←──Bridge──→ Arbitrum
    ↕                      ↕
  Bridge                 Bridge
    ↕                      ↕
 Base    ←──Bridge──→  Polygon
```

**Use cases**:
- Move ETH from Ethereum to Arbitrum for cheaper DeFi
- Access protocols only available on specific chains
- Consolidate assets scattered across chains

## Bridge Architectures

### Type 1: Native Bridges (Official L2 Bridges)

Used by rollup L2s to move between L1 and L2.

| Bridge | Route | Deposit Time | Withdrawal Time |
|--------|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Arbitrum Bridge** | ETH ↔ Arbitrum | ~10 min | **7 days** (fraud proof) |
| **Optimism Bridge** | ETH ↔ Optimism | ~10 min | **7 days** (fraud proof) |
| **Base Bridge** | ETH ↔ Base | ~10 min | **7 days** |
| **zkSync Bridge** | ETH ↔ zkSync | ~10 min | ~1 hour (ZK proof) |

**The 7-day problem**: Optimistic rollups require a 7-day challenge period for withdrawals to L1. This is why third-party bridges exist.

### Type 2: Liquidity Network Bridges

Pre-fund liquidity on both chains. Users swap locally:

```
User deposits ETH on Chain A → Receives ETH from liquidity pool on Chain B
(No actual cross-chain message needed — just liquidity matching)
```

| Bridge | Speed | Chains | Best For |
|--------|-------|--------|----------|
| **Stargate** | 1–5 min | 15+ | Stablecoins, large amounts |
| **Across** | 2–10 min | 10+ | ETH, fast transfers |
| **Hop** | 5–20 min | 5+ | ETH, stablecoins |

**Pros**: Fast, no 7-day wait
**Cons**: Limited by available liquidity, fees

### Type 3: Message-Passing Bridges

Send a message cross-chain, mint/release on destination:

| Bridge | Mechanism | Chains |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Wormhole** | Guardian network validates | 30+ |
| **LayerZero** | Oracle + relayer (ultralight) | 30+ |
| **Axelar** | PoS validator network | 50+ |

**Pros**: Support many chains and token types
**Cons**: Trust additional validator set, historically targeted by hackers

### Type 4: Lock-and-Mint

```
1. Lock tokens on Chain A
2. Mint wrapped tokens on Chain B
3. To return: Burn on Chain B → Unlock on Chain A
```

Used by: Wormhole (wETH), Multichain (any-token), many protocol-specific bridges

**Risk**: If bridge contract is hacked, all locked tokens are at risk.

## Bridge Comparison

| Bridge | Speed | Cost | Security | Best For |
|--------|-------|------|----------|----------|
| **Official L2 Bridge** | 10 min in / 7 days out | Gas only | Highest (L1 security) | Large amounts, no rush |
| **Stargate** | 1–5 min | ~$0.50–5 | High (LayerZero) | Stablecoins |
| **Across** | 2–10 min | ~$0.50–3 | High (UMA optimistic) | ETH, fast transfers |
| **Hop** | 5–20 min | ~$1–5 | High (AMM model) | Proven, reliable |
| **Wormhole** | 5–15 min | Variable | Medium (guardian set) | Multi-chain (Solana) |
| **Synapse** | 5–15 min | ~$1–5 | Medium | Wide chain support |

## Security History

Bridges have been the #1 target for hacks in crypto:

| Bridge | Date | Loss | What Happened |
|--------|------|------|--------------|
| Ronin (Axie) | Mar 2022 | $625M | Validator keys compromised |
| Wormhole | Feb 2022 | $325M | Smart contract bug |
| Nomad | Aug 2022 | $190M | Logic error in verification |
| Multichain | Jul 2023 | $130M | Admin key compromise |
| Harmony | Jun 2022 | $100M | Multisig key theft |

**Lesson**: Bridges are high-value targets. Use established bridges with strong security track records.

## Bridging to Arbitrum (Sperax's Home Chain)

To use Sperax (USDs, SPA staking, Farms), you need assets on Arbitrum:

### Recommended Paths

| From | Asset | Recommended Bridge | Time | Cost |
|------|-------|--------------------|------|------|
| Ethereum | ETH | Across or Stargate | 2–5 min | ~$1–3 |
| Ethereum | USDC | Stargate | 1–5 min | ~$0.50–2 |
| Ethereum | Any ERC-20 | Arbitrum Official Bridge | 10 min | Gas only |
| Base | ETH/USDC | Stargate or Across | 2–5 min | ~$0.50–2 |
| Optimism | ETH/USDC | Stargate or Across | 2–5 min | ~$0.50–2 |
| Polygon | USDC | Stargate | 1–5 min | ~$0.50 |

### Step-by-Step: Bridge ETH to Arbitrum

```
1. Go to bridge.arbitrum.io (official) or across.to (faster)
2. Connect wallet
3. Select: From Ethereum → To Arbitrum
4. Enter ETH amount
5. Review fees and estimated time
6. Approve and send transaction
7. Wait for confirmation on Arbitrum
8. Verify on Arbiscan that funds arrived
```

## Best Practices

### Safety Checklist

- [ ] **Use established bridges only** — Stargate, Across, Hop, official L2 bridges
- [ ] **Verify the URL** — bookmark bridge sites, don't click links
- [ ] **Start with a small test** — bridge $10 first before large amounts
- [ ] **Check bridge TVL** — higher TVL = more battle-tested
- [ ] **Verify on destination** — confirm tokens arrived on the destination chain
- [ ] **Understand wrapped vs native** — bridged USDC might be different from native USDC

### Common Mistakes

| Mistake | How to Avoid |
|---------|-------------|
| Bridging to wrong chain | Double-check destination chain before confirming |
| Not having gas on destination | Keep 0.001+ ETH on Arbitrum/L2 for gas |
| Using a hacked/deprecated bridge | Check if bridge is still active and maintained |
| Bridging during congestion | Check L1 gas prices if bridging via Ethereum |
| Getting wrapped tokens instead of native | Some bridges give wrapped USDC.e instead of native USDC |

### Native vs Wrapped Tokens

| Term | Meaning | Example on Arbitrum |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| **Native** | Issued directly on the chain | USDC (Circle native) |
| **Bridged/Wrapped** | Bridged version of an L1 token | USDC.e (bridged from Ethereum) |

Both are usable, but native is preferred for DeFi (better liquidity, no bridge risk).

> **Sperax accepts both**: USDs can be minted with both USDC (native) and USDC.e (bridged) on Arbitrum.

## Cost Optimization

### Tips

1. **Use L2-to-L2 bridges** when possible (skip L1 entirely)
2. **Bridge during low-gas periods** (weekends, US nighttime)
3. **Batch your bridging** — one $1000 bridge is cheaper than ten $100 bridges
4. **Compare on aggregators** — Li.Fi, Bungee, and Socket aggregate multiple bridges

### Bridge Cost Aggregators

| Aggregator | What It Does |
|------------|-------------|
| **Li.Fi** | Compares routes across bridges + DEXes |
| **Bungee** (Socket) | Multi-bridge route optimization |
| **Jumper** | Cross-chain swap + bridge in one tx |

## Agent Tips

1. **Official L2 bridges are safest** but slowest (7-day withdrawal)
2. **Stargate for stablecoins, Across for ETH** — best speed/security balance
3. **Never use unknown bridges** — bridge hacks are the largest losses in crypto
4. **Always keep gas on destination** — users forget they need ETH for gas on L2
5. **Test with small amount first** — especially on a new bridge or chain
6. **For Sperax/Arbitrum users**: Across or Stargate from Ethereum is the recommended path
